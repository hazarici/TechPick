This is a university project: a simple PC store web application.  



\## Requirements

\- Node.js (LTS) installed from https://nodejs.org/



\## First Time Setup

1\. Open `cmd/setup.cmd` (double-click)  

&nbsp;  - This installs all necessary dependencies for backend and frontend



\## Starting the Project

1\. After setup, open `cmd/run.cmd` (double-click)  

&nbsp;  - This opens two terminals:

&nbsp;    - Backend server

&nbsp;    - Frontend React app



\## Notes

\- `.gitignore` is configured to ignore `node\_modules`, build files, and `.env`.

\- If you update dependencies later, run `npm install` in `backend` and `client` folders manually.
